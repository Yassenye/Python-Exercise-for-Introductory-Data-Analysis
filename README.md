# Python-Exercise-for-Introductory-Data-Analysis
Python Data Analysis Project

Project Overview

This project demonstrates an introductory data analysis exercise using Python. It focuses on applying essential Python libraries to perform data manipulation, visualization, and analysis in a structured environment. The exercise is designed to enhance fundamental Python skills while exploring real-world datasets.

Tools and Technologies

The following tools and libraries were utilized in this project:

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

NumPy: For numerical computations.

Matplotlib: For creating visualizations.

Pyodide: To run Python in a browser-based environment.

Piplite and Micropip: For managing Python package dependencies in the web environment.

Project Objectives

Load and preprocess data efficiently using Python.

Explore and analyze key metrics, such as house prices, consumer price index, population growth, and unemployment rates over time.

Visualize data to derive meaningful insights and trends.

Key Features

Data Exploration: Display and summarize key statistics of the dataset, including temporal trends in economic indicators.

Interactive Environment: Uses Pyodide to enable seamless execution in web-based platforms.

Visualization: Generates plots to illustrate patterns and insights within the data.

Outputs

The project outputs include:

Data Tables: Processed datasets showcasing economic indicators over a specified time frame.

Visual Representations: Graphical insights into trends and correlations among variables like house prices, consumer price index, and more.

Setup and Usage

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Ensure Python 3.x is installed along with the necessary libraries:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib

To execute the notebook locally:

Open the .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

Run all cells sequentially to replicate the analysis.

For web-based execution, deploy using Pyodide.

Learnings and Challenges
